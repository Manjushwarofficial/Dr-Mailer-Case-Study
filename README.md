# Dr. Mailer – Case Study

A secure, intelligent desktop email client designed to automate professional email management. This case study highlights the project’s goals, core features, workflow, and technical insights — while omitting sensitive client information.



## Overview

Dr. Mailer streamlines email handling by using machine learning to automatically classify and label incoming emails, creating a more organized and efficient workflow.  
This case study summarizes the approach, key design decisions, and the technology stack used to build a local desktop application with minimal external dependencies.



## Core Features

- **Intelligent Email Classification**  
  Incoming emails are automatically categorized using a trained `scikit-learn` model (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine).

- **Secure Credential Management**  
  User credentials are stored securely using environment variables rather than hardcoding.

- **Full Email Functionality**  
  Supports sending, receiving, and managing emails (including attachments).

- **Desktop GUI**  
  Clean, user-friendly interface built using a native Python GUI framework (Tkinter, CustomTkinter, or PyQt).



## Technology Stack

**Backend:**  
- **Language:** Python 3.9+  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn for classification  
- **Data Handling:** pandas for preprocessing  
- **Email Protocols:** smtplib (send) and imaplib (receive/manage)  
- **Security:** python-dotenv for credential management  

**Frontend (GUI):**  
- Native Python GUI framework (Tkinter / PyQt / CustomTkinter)



## Project Workflow

1. **Data preprocessing** – email data cleaned and labeled for ML model training.  
2. **Model training** – tested multiple classifiers to optimize accuracy.  
3. **Integration** – ML pipeline embedded into the desktop application.  
4. **Testing & security hardening** – ensured credentials are environment-managed and not exposed.  
5. **Milestone delivery** – structured around core feature completion and client reviews.  



## Case Study Purpose

This repository serves as a public-facing portfolio version of the original private project.  
- **No sensitive code or credentials are included.**
- **Contains workflow diagrams, feature explanations, and demo snippets.**  
- **Intended to showcase technical capability and process, not a production build.**
